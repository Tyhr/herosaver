Herosaver
=========

After kindly beeing contacted by the HeroForge staff I decided to take down the
repository. I initially started the project when you only could order physical
miniatures from HeroForge. While the price of the miniatures was reasonable,
shipping costs to Germany was in my opinion unreasonable high. Since you can
now order the .stl files from HeroForge for about 10$ (and to my shame this
option is now available for quiet some time), I will discontinue this software.

By buying the .stl file from HeroForge you do not only support the HeroForge
team, you also get a model that is much more detailed, than the model you were
able to export using HeroSaver (Including the applied morphs I always struggled
with).

While the ease of use of the editor and selection of character options on
HeroForge remain unmatched (to my knowlege), I found this site
[desktophero3d.com](http://desktophero3d.com/) as an alternative for free
RPG miniatures, if you cannot afford the models of HeroForge.

So long,
  Christoph
